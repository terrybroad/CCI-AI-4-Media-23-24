#  Object for the Generator class
#  The generator is nearly a symmetrical network to the discriminator
#  It takes a small input (latent vector z) and expands it up to an image with transposed convolutional layers
class Generator(nn.Module):
    # Constructor for the class
    def __init__(self, z_dim, n_f_maps, num_channels):
        # Call the constructor of the base class nn.module
        super(Generator, self).__init__()
        
        # The transposed convolutional layers of the network
        # There are four layers, all with a kernal size of four
        # The stride in layer 1 is 1 pixel, the stride is two in the higher layers
        #Â For more info on transposed convolutions see: https://medium.com/@marsxiang/convolutions-transposed-and-deconvolution-6430c358a5b6

#  Object for the Discriminator class
#  The disciminator is a binary classifier (Fake vs Real)
#  This model is very similiar to the code in Week 3 for image classification
